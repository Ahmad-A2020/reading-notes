####  Java Inheritance & Interfaces Tutorial
- An **interface** is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of one of its implemented interfaces or base-classes rather than specifying the specific class.
- To use an interface, you write a class that implements the interface. When an instantiable class implements an interface, it provides a method body for each of the methods declared in the interface.
- An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword interface, the interface name, a comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the interface body.
- An interface can extend other interfaces.
- The interface body can contain abstract methods, default methods, and static methods.
- To declare a class that implements an interface, you include an implements clause in the class declaration.
- When you define a new interface, you are defining a new reference data type. You can use interface names anywhere you can use any other data type name
