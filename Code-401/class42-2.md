### Ethics: 

##### Google and AI: 

Google is committing to not using artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance after employees protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage.
Employees at the company have spent months protesting Google’s involvement in Project Maven, sending a letter to Pichai demanding that Google terminate its contract with the Department of Defens. Academics and students in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence joined Google employees in voicing concerns about Project Maven, arguing that Google was unethically paving the way for the creation of fully autonomous weapons. Asaro praised Google’s ethical principles for their commitment to building socially beneficial AI, avoiding bias, and building in privacy and accountability.
The internal and external protests put Google in a difficult position as it aims to recenter its business around the development and use of artificial intelligence.In the absence of positive actions, such as publicly supporting an international ban on autonomous weapons, Google will have to offer more public transparency as to the systems they build. Otherwise we will continue to rely on the conscientious employees wiling to risk their positions in Google to ensure the company ‘does no evil.

##### Cyber-Security of self driving cars:

Ten million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020, according to an in-depth report by Business Insider Intelligence.technology has the potential to benefit society in a range of ways, from boosting economic productivity to reducing urban congestion.
If the car does any significant computations by connecting to the outside world via the cloud, needs some sort of internet-connectivity for its functionality, or completely relies on outside sensors for making all decisions, then yes, it might be susceptible to hackers.researchers have presented several efficient hacks against some current carmakers.For example, a team of researchers at the University of California San Diego published a series of papers about five years ago in which it demonstrated hacks that could even activate the breaks of a car while the car was traveling. car manufacturers, like other industries, are trying to come up with defense techniques that can prevent attacks against their systems.
