#### Stacks and
- Stack: A **stack:** is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
- Common terminology for a stack is:
    - Push - to add Nodes or items.
    - Pop - to remove Nodes or items.
    - Top - This is the top of the stack
    - Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
    - IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
Stacks concepts:
- FILO (First In Last Out):   This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
-LIFO(Last In First Out): This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

##### Queues:
- a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.
Common terminology for a queue is
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
