A Java object is a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make certain type of data useful.

### Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones).
- A Java object is a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make certain type of data useful.
- Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:
   - Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects.
   - Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods.
   - Code re-use: If an object already exists, you can use that object in your program. 
   - Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic. 
- A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: it describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods).
-  To create a class, use the keyword class    
 
### Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section). 
- a class declaration: below is an a syntax to declare class. which includes: 
      - class keyword to initiate the class statement. 
      - Modifiers such as public, private. 
      - The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
      - the name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. 
      - A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements.

`public class MyClass extends MySuperClass implements YourInterface {`
    `// field, constructor, and`
    `// method declarations`
`}`

### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers.
- Binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system.
- The decimal numeral system is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system. 
- Hexadecimal Number System is one the type of Number Representation techniques, in which there value of base is 16. That means there are only 16 symbols or possible digit values, there are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. It requires only 4 bits to represent value of any digit.
