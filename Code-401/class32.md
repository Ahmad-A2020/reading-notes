### Intro to Serverless
- Definition : Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.
- cloude provider : following is a list of main provider for such service 
            - AWS Lambda
            -  Google Cloud Functions
             - Azure Functions
             -  IBM OpenWhisk

             - Iron Functions 
             -Auth0 Webtask
             -  Oracle Fn Project
- Advantages: 
        -  no longer need to worry about the underlying servers. Reason being, they are not managed by you anymore and with management out of the picture the responsibility falls on the Cloud vendors.
        -  reduced cost
